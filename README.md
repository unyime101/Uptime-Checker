# 📡 Router Uptime Monitor

📌 **Project Overview** 
I'm building a Python-based uptime monitor that runs on my Raspberry Pi 5 to track the availability of my home router.

As a university student, I'm often away from home — but I still get contacted whenever devices lose internet connectivity. This tool is meant to help me monitor the router's status so I can keep tabs on connection health and understand recurring issues remotely.

The script is being developed to run on Ubuntu Linux (on Raspberry Pi) but will be portable to other Linux environments.
